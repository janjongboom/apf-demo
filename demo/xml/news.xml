        The next generation. 
        After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/en/Star_Trek_The_Next_Generation" target="_blank">famous Star Trek series</a>,
        which we all remember as a worthy and successful sequel, Javeline announces
        the immediate availability of Platform 2.0.<br />

        So, why 2.0 you ask? The reason is quite simple:<br />
        a) we used the 1.0 version internally extensively for a couple of large projects and<br />
        b) the core architecture has changed so dramatically since the last public release of 0.9.8, that 2.0 really is the only way to name it<br />
        Here\'s a basic overview of the most important changes:<br />

        All of the above is accompanied by the launch of the new Home for apf: Ajax.org.
        A brand-spanking new website dedicated entirely to the community and all of its
        content licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/" target="_blank">CC</a>.
        That means: please, spread the word! Start playing around with the package(s) and
        tell us what you think in the <a href="http://www.ajax.org/community/forum">forums</a>,
        share your experience and apf-related knowledge on the wiki!
        </p>

        This new version of apf is not so much a revolution, but the result of an
        <em>evolution</em> that has started almost eight years ago. <a href="http://www.rubendaniels.com" target="_blank">Ruben</a>
        joined the Ajax crowd before it was even there, developed the first publicly
        available XHR wrapper and that was the start of apf. <a href="http://www.mikedeboer.nl">Mike de Boer</a>
        joined Ruben in August 2008 to aid in taking apf to the next level, bringing
        in the lessons learnt while developing the Web Application at technology startup
        <a href="http://www.ebuddy.com" target="_blank">eBuddy.com</a>.
        Together, they redesigned the architecture and Lukasz then built further upon
        these building blocks with a handful of elements/ components.
